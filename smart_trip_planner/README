🗺️ Tourist Itinerary Planner
📘 Overview

Tourist Itinerary Planner is a smart web-based project that helps tourists plan their trip efficiently by selecting, scheduling, and mapping the best places to visit based on their available time and preferences.

It uses three powerful algorithms — Knapsack, Activity Selection, and Hamiltonian Path — to optimize the itinerary for:

Best possible enjoyment (ratings)

Time efficiency (no overlaps)

Logical travel route (each place visited once)

This project can be applied to any city or travel destination, not just one specific location.

🚀 Features

✅ Upload CSV file of tourist spots
✅ Generate optimized travel plan based on available hours
✅ Visualize route order using interactive graphs and charts
✅ View detailed itinerary within the same web UI
✅ Works for any city (Goa, Mumbai, Jaipur, etc.)

📊 CSV Format

The planner uses a simple CSV file as input.
Here’s the format:

Place,Time (hrs),Rating
Baga Beach,2,9
Fort Aguada,3,8
Anjuna Market,1.5,7
Basilica of Bom Jesus,2,8
Dudhsagar Falls,4,10

⚙️ How It Works (Algorithm Flow)
1. 🎒 Knapsack Algorithm

Purpose: Selects which tourist places to include in the trip.

Input: Each place’s time required and rating.

Logic: Maximizes total rating without exceeding total available time.

Output: List of places that give best satisfaction under time limit.

💡 Example:
If you have 8 hours, it picks the best combination of places within 8 hours total.

2. ⏰ Activity Selection Algorithm

Purpose: Schedules chosen places in non-overlapping time slots.

Logic: Greedy approach — always pick the next activity that finishes earliest.

Output: Proper daily schedule with no overlaps.

💡 Example:
Visits are ordered by available time window — e.g., 9–11 (Beach), 11–13 (Museum), 14–16 (Market).

3. 🗺️ Hamiltonian Path Algorithm

Purpose: Determines the route visiting every selected place exactly once.

Logic: Connects all places like nodes in a graph.

Output: A route such as Beach → Fort → Museum → Market.

💡 If distances are added, this becomes the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for the shortest path.

🌐 Visualization

The planner UI displays:

📈 Bar chart — shows time and ratings for each selected place.

🗺️ Graph visualization — shows connected route between places (Hamiltonian path).

📅 Itinerary summary — table of day plan with order, time, and rating.

🧠 Example Output (Goa)

User Input:
Total available time = 8 hours
Uploaded CSV = list of 8–10 Goa places

Output:

Selected (Knapsack): Beach, Fort, Museum, Market

Scheduled (Activity Selection): Morning → Evening slots

Route (Hamiltonian): Beach → Fort → Museum → Market

Displayed as:

Timeline of places

Graph connecting all spots

Ratings vs. time chart

🧰 How to Run

Save the project files in a folder.

Open index.html in any browser.

Upload a CSV file (as per the format above).

Click “Generate Itinerary”.

The optimized itinerary, chart, and map visualization appear instantly in the UI.
